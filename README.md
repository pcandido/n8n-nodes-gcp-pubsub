# n8n-nodes-gcp-pubsub

This is an n8n community node that provides integration with Google Cloud Pub/Sub messaging service. It allows you to publish and subscribe to messages using Pub/Sub topics and subscriptions in your n8n workflows.

Google Cloud Pub/Sub is a messaging service for exchanging event data among applications and services. It provides reliable, many-to-many, asynchronous messaging between applications.

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.

## Installation

Follow the [installation guide](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation/) in the n8n community nodes documentation.

1. Go to **Settings > Community Nodes**.
2. Select **Install**.
3. Enter `n8n-nodes-gcp-pubsub` in **Enter npm package name**.
4. Agree to the [risks](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/risks/) of using community nodes: select **I understand the risks of installing unverified code from a public source**.
5. Select **Install**.

After installing the node, you can use it like any other node. n8n displays the node in search results in the **Nodes** panel.

## Nodes

This package contains two nodes for working with Google Cloud Pub/Sub:

### GCP Pub/Sub Publisher

The Publisher node allows you to publish messages to a Pub/Sub topic.

#### Parameters

- **Project ID** (required): The Google Cloud Project ID where your Pub/Sub topic exists
- **Topic Name** (required): The name of the Pub/Sub topic to publish messages to

#### Features

- Publishes the entire input data as JSON to the specified topic
- Returns the message ID upon successful publication
- Supports error handling with continue on fail option
- Can be used as a tool in AI workflows

#### Input/Output

- **Input**: Any JSON data that you want to publish to the topic
- **Output**: Original data plus a `result` object containing:
  - `success`: boolean indicating if the message was published successfully
  - `messageId`: the unique identifier of the published message

### GCP Pub/Sub Subscriber

The Subscriber node is a trigger node that listens for messages from a Pub/Sub subscription.

#### Parameters

- **Project ID** (required): The Google Cloud Project ID where your Pub/Sub subscription exists
- **Subscription Name** (required): The name of the Pub/Sub subscription to listen to

#### Features

- Continuously listens for messages from the specified subscription
- Automatically acknowledges messages after processing
- Handles both JSON and text message payloads
- Provides comprehensive message metadata

#### Output

Each received message outputs:
- **id**: The unique message ID
- **attributes**: Message attributes (key-value pairs)
- **data**: The message payload (parsed as JSON if possible, otherwise as string)
- **publishTime**: When the message was published
- **received**: Timestamp when the message was received by the node

## Credentials

Both nodes require Google Cloud Platform Service Account credentials to authenticate with the Pub/Sub service.

### Setting up GCP Service Account

1. **Create or select a Google Cloud Project**:
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Select an existing project or create a new one

2. **Enable the Pub/Sub API**:
   - In the Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services > Library**
   - Search for "Cloud Pub/Sub API" and enable it

3. **Create a Service Account**:
   - Go to **IAM & Admin > Service Accounts**
   - Click **Create Service Account**
   - Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "n8n-pubsub-service-account")
   - Add a description for clarity

4. **Grant necessary permissions**:
   Choose one of these permission sets based on your needs:
   - **Pub/Sub Admin** (for full access to all Pub/Sub resources)
   - **Pub/Sub Editor** (for read/write access)
   - Or create a custom role with specific permissions:
     - `pubsub.topics.publish` (for Publisher node)
     - `pubsub.subscriptions.consume` (for Subscriber node)
     - `pubsub.messages.ack` (for message acknowledgment)

5. **Generate and download the key**:
   - Select your service account
   - Go to the **Keys** tab
   - Click **Add Key > Create new key**
   - Select **JSON** format
   - Download the key file

6. **Configure credentials in n8n**:
   - In n8n, go to **Settings > Credentials**
   - Click **Create New Credential**
   - Select **Google Cloud Platform Service Account API**
   - Copy the entire contents of the downloaded JSON file
   - Paste it into the **Service Account JSON** field
   - Save the credential

### Example Service Account JSON Structure

```json
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "your-project-id",
  "private_key_id": "key-id",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
  "client_email": "service-account@your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "client_id": "client-id",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
  "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/service-account%40your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
}
```

### Security Best Practices

- Store the service account JSON securely and never commit it to version control
- Use the principle of least privilege (only grant necessary permissions)
- Regularly rotate service account keys
- Monitor service account usage in the Cloud Console
- Consider using Workload Identity in production environments

## Compatibility

- **Minimum n8n version**: 1.0.0
- **Tested with**: n8n v1.0.0+
- **Node API version**: 1
- **Dependencies**: @google-cloud/pubsub v5.2.0+

## Usage

### Basic Publisher Example

1. Add a **Manual Trigger** or any input node
2. Add the **GCP Pub/Sub Publisher** node
3. Configure the Project ID and Topic Name
4. Select your GCP Service Account credentials
5. The node will publish whatever data flows into it

### Basic Subscriber Example

1. Add the **GCP Pub/Sub Subscriber** trigger node
2. Configure the Project ID and Subscription Name
3. Select your GCP Service Account credentials
4. The workflow will trigger whenever a message is received

### Advanced Usage

**Message Processing Pipeline**:
```
Subscriber → Process Data → Publisher
```

**Error Handling**:
Enable "Continue on Fail" in the Publisher node to handle publishing errors gracefully.

**Message Attributes**:
The Subscriber node provides access to message attributes, which can be used for routing or filtering logic.

### Prerequisites

Before using these nodes, ensure you have:
- A Google Cloud Platform account with billing enabled
- A project with the Pub/Sub API enabled
- At least one Pub/Sub topic and subscription created
- Proper IAM permissions configured

To create topics and subscriptions, you can use the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudpubsub) or the `gcloud` CLI tool.
